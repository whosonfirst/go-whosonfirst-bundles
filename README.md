# go-whosonfirst-bundles

Go package for working with Who's On First data bundles

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.6 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Important

**This does not work yet. Like at all.**

This is work in progress. It may change (and break your code) still.
